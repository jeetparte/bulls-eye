## About

This is a game I made as part of a [raywenderlich.com iOS learning course][1]. It covered iOS 11 and Swift 4.

This was a basic course. Some of the topics that were covered in this course:

* using various UI elements - buttons, sliders etc. and styling them.
* hooking up UI to code - using Interface Builder with the  `@IBAction` and `@IBOutlet` attributes.
* making use of [web views][2] to display web pages.
* basics of [AutoLayout][3].

## Game description
Win points and earn fame by dragging a slider.
Your goal is to place the slider as close as possible to the target value. The closer you are, the more you score.
*Enjoy!*

## Bonus story

The *watch on piano* picture above was clicked by me.

It's a photo of my Timex weekender watch on my piano. I entered the photo in a watch photography competition and although I didn't win, I'm happy with the photos and the efforts, which let me indulge my creativity.
